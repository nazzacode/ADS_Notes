The solution is obtaine by evaluating a sum that arises from the pattern. Since the pattern is just for the 'neat' $n$, the method is regorous only if we verify the solution (e.g. by a direct induction proof). Often in practice the way to do the proof is to relate to the 'neat' values in some way.\n",

Then apply monotonicity (2) to show a relationship between $T'(n)$ and $T'(\\hat{n})$, and finally substitute the eact expression (from (1)) to $T'(\\hat{n})$ to work out a bound for $T'(n)$. "
