    "###### __PROOF__\n",
    "Necessary Condition (1): Throughout execution, $\\mathcal{T}$ remains a tree.\\\n",
    "Necessary Condition (2): All vertices will eventually be added to $\\mathcal{T}$.\\\n",
    "Necessary Condition (3): Throughout execution, $\\mathcal{T}$ is contained in some MST of $\\mathcal{G}.$ \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of (1)\n",
    "Necessary Condition (i): $\\mathcal{T}$ is always connected.\\\n",
    "Necessary Condition (ii): $\\mathcal{T}$ never contains a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (i). only edges with an endpoint in $\\mathcal{T}$ are added to $\\mathcal{T}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ remains connected\\\n",
    "  (ii). We never add an edge with both endpoints in $\\mathcal{T}$ so the algorith never constructs a cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of (2)\n",
    "As $\\mathcal{G}$ is connected, and primms algorithm only terminates when there are no fringe edges, every edge will become a frige and therefore be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of (3)\n",
    "Suppose that $\\mathcal{T}$ in contained in an MST $\\mathcal{T'}$ and that fringe edge $e =(u,v)$ is then added to $\\mathcal{T}$ by Primm. We shall prove that $\\mathcal{T} + e$ is contained in some MST.\n",
    "\n",
    "case (i): $e$ is contained in $\\mathcal{T'}$. Hence $\\mathcal{T} + e$ is in a MST.\\\n",
    "case (ii): $e \\not\\in \\mathcal{T'}$, consider the unique path $\\mathcal{P}$ from $u$ to $v$ in $\\mathcal{T}$. then $\\mathcal{P}$ contains _exactly_ one fringe edge $e' = (u',v')$ with $W(e) \\leq W(e')$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Images/prims_tree_proof.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "  - let $\\mathcal{T''} = \\mathcal{T'} + e - e'$\n",
    "  - $\\mathcal{T''}$ is a tree as dropping $e'$ must split the tree into two components, with $x$ and $y$ being in different components (becuase we have broken the unique path between them), hence adding $e$ does not create a cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence $\\mathcal{T''}$ is an MST as it has the same vertices as $\\mathcal{T'}$ and this completes our proof."
